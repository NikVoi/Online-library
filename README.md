## Technologies Used

- **React (JavaScript)**: React was selected as the frontend framework due to its popularity, robust ecosystem, and the ability to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability, making it an excellent choice for developing a modern web application like the online library.

- **SCSS (Sass)**: SCSS was chosen for styling the project because of its enhanced features over traditional CSS. SCSS offers variables, nesting, and modularity, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable styles. This is crucial for efficiently managing the design of a content-rich application like an online library.

- **VITE**: VITE was employed as the build tool for its speed and efficiency in developing modern JavaScript applications. VITE's quick development server and out-of-the-box support for React and SCSS streamline the development process, making it a practical choice for this project.

- **Google API**: The integration of Google API was chosen to fetch and display book-related information. Google APIs offer a vast library of data sources and services, making it a reliable choice for acquiring real-time data to enrich the online library's content. This API provides up-to-date book details, enhancing the user experience by delivering accurate and current information.

The combination of these technologies ensures a robust, maintainable, and efficient development process for the Online Library project, resulting in a user-friendly and feature-rich web application.
